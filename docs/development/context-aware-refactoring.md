# Context-Aware Model Class Refactoring

## Overview

The Model class has been refactored to properly use the existing Archive3mf and Directory context system instead of creating its own contexts within class methods. This improves architecture consistency and follows the library's design patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Instance Methods (Context-Aware)

These methods work within existing Archive3mf and Directory contexts:

- **`load_stl_with_info(stl_path)`** - Load STL with rich console output
- **`analyze_model_content()`** - Analyze and display model statistics 
- **`add_conversion_metadata(stl_path)`** - Add metadata to current archive context

### 2. Refactored Class Methods

Updated existing class methods to properly use the context system:

- **`convert_stl_to_3mf()`** - Now uses proper Archive3mf → Directory → Model context chain
- **`analyze_3mf_content()`** - Uses context system and delegates to instance method
- **`batch_convert_stl_files()`** - Already correct, uses convert_stl_to_3mf()


## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Class Methods (Self-Contained)
```python
# Handles all context creation internally
Model.convert_stl_to_3mf(Path("input.stl"), Path("output.3mf"))
Model.analyze_3mf_content(Path("output.3mf"))
```

### Pattern 2: Instance Methods (Context-Aware)
```python
# Work within existing contexts
with Archive3mf('output.3mf', 'w') as archive:
    with Directory('3D') as models_dir:
        with Model() as model:
            obj_id = model.load_stl_with_info(Path('model.stl'))
            model.analyze_model_content()
            model.add_conversion_metadata(Path('model.stl'))
```

### Pattern 3: Advanced Multi-Model Usage
```python
with Archive3mf('assembly.3mf', 'w') as archive:
    with Directory('3D') as models_dir:
        # Multiple models in same archive
        with Model('part1.model') as model1:
            model1.load_stl_with_info(Path('part1.stl'))
            
        with Model('part2.model') as model2:
            model2.load_stl_with_info(Path('part2.stl'))
```

## Benefits

✅ **Proper Context Management** - No duplicate context creation or resource leaks
✅ **Architecture Consistency** - Follows established Archive3mf → Directory → Model pattern  
✅ **Flexibility** - Can work within existing contexts or create new ones
✅ **Single Responsibility** - Class methods handle high-level operations, instance methods handle model operations
✅ **Maintainability** - Clear separation between context creation and model manipulation
✅ **Extensibility** - Easy to add new context-aware methods

## Files Updated

- `noah123d/model.py` - Added context-aware methods and refactored existing ones
- `examples/example_simple_conversion.py` - Updated to show both usage patterns
- `examples/context_aware_demo.py` - New demo showing context-aware usage
- `examples/model_class_demo.py` - Updated documentation

## Migration Guide

### Before (Anti-pattern)
```python
# Methods created their own contexts internally
Model.convert_stl_to_3mf(stl_path, output_path)
```

### After (Recommended)
```python
# Option 1: Class methods (unchanged API)
Model.convert_stl_to_3mf(stl_path, output_path)

# Option 2: Context-aware (new capability)
with Archive3mf(output_path, 'w') as archive:
    with Directory('3D') as models_dir:
        with Model() as model:
            model.load_stl_with_info(stl_path)
```

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility while adding new context-aware capabilities for advanced users.
