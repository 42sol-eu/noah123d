Feature: CLI Basic Functionality # features/cli_basic.feature:1
  As a user of noah123d
  I want to interact with the command-line interface
  So that I can process 3D models effectively
  Background:   # features/cli_basic.feature:6

  Scenario: Display help information                                                          # features/cli_basic.feature:9
    Given the noah123d CLI is available                                                       # features/steps/cli_basic_steps.py:11
    When I run the command with "--help" option                                               # features/steps/cli_basic_steps.py:18
    Then I should see the help text                                                           # features/steps/cli_basic_steps.py:45
    And the help text should contain "Noah123d - CLI for building assemblies from STL models" # features/steps/cli_basic_steps.py:52
    And the exit code should be 0                                                             # features/steps/cli_basic_steps.py:94

  So that I get meaningful feedback when things go wrong
Feature: Model Processing # features/model_processing.feature:1
  As a user of noah123d
  I want to process STL model files
  So that I can build assemblies from 3D models
